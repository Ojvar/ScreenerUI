Events-Handlers Structure

All event handlers place in /app/handlers folder

Event-handler files should be in format "XXX-event.js"
You can raise an event "XXX" by doing this, use event name without "-event.js" ;)

    const events = use('core/modules/events-module');
    const data = {};
    events.raise('XXX', data);
